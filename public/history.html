    <h3>Ancient History:</h3>
    <br />
    India's history and culture is dynamic, spanning back to the beginning of
    human civilization.
    <br />
    It begins with Vedas and Puranas with Mythological Epic Era of Ramayana and
    Mahabharata and dividing the Indian Civilisation into 4 Yuga's - 1. Satyug,
    2. TretaYug, 3. Dwapar Yug and 4. Kalyug.
    <br />
    India developed with a mysterious culture along the Indus River and River
    Ganga and in farming communities in the southern lands of India.
    <br />
    The history of India is punctuated by constant integration of migrating
    people with the diverse cultures that surround India. Available evidence
    suggests that the use of iron, copper and other metals was widely prevalent
    in the Indian sub-continent at a fairly early period, which is indicative of
    the progress that this part of the world had made. By the end of the fourth
    millennium BC, India had emerged as a region of highly developed
    civilization.
    <br />
    From Fire, Wheel, Houses in Mountain, River Basins, Bulluck Cart, Zero,
    Yoga, Jyotish, Traditional Ayurveda, YAzna Vizhyan to Centers of Education
    like Nalanda and Takshila, Emergance of Buddism and Jainism to Sikkism,
    India's Culture is having Deep Roots.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Vedic Civilization</h3>
    <br />
    The Vedic civilization is the earliest civilization in the history of
    ancient India. It is named after the Vedas, the early literature of the
    Hindu people. The Vedic Civilization flourished along the river Saraswati,
    in a region that now consists of the modern Indian states of Haryana and
    Punjab. Vedic is synonymous with Hinduism, which is another name for
    religious and spiritual thought that has evolved from the Vedas.
    <br />
    The Ramayana and Mahabharata were the two great epics of this period.
    <br />
    18 Puranas
    <br /><br />
    There are 4 vedas (word of Sanskrit origin, translating to ‘Knowledge’ or
    ‘To Know’), <br />
    <ol>
      <li>1. Rig Veda</li>
      <li>2. Yajur Veda</li>
      <li>3. Sama Veda</li>
      <li>4. Atharva Veda</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    All of them together are attributed to as ‘Chaturveda’. The Rig Veda serves
    as the principal one and all three but the Arthaveda agree with one another
    in form, language, and content.<br />
    Each Veda has been subclassified into four major text types – The Samhitas,
    the most ancient layer of text in the Vedas, consisting of mantras, hymns,
    prayers, and benedictions which has in literary terms put together or joined
    the other three texts; the Aranyakas which constitute the philosophy behind
    the ritual sacrifice, the Brahmanas which inturn has the commentary on hymns
    of four Vedas and the Upasanas, the one that focuses on worship.
    <br /><br />

    The Indus Valley Civilization <br />
    The History of India begins with the birth of the Indus Valley Civilization,
    more precisely known as Harappan Civilization. It flourished around 2,500
    BC, in the western part of South Asia, what today is Pakistan and Western
    India. The Indus Valley was home to the largest of the four ancient urban
    civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, India and China. Nothing was known
    about this civilization till 1920s when the Archaeological Department of
    India carried out excavations in the Indus valley wherein the ruins of the
    two old cities, viz. Mohenjodaro and Harappa were unearthed. The ruins of
    buildings and other things like household articles, weapons of war, gold and
    silver ornaments, seals, toys, pottery wares, etc., show that some four to
    five thousand years ago a highly developed Civilization flourished in this
    region. <br />
    <br /><br />
    The Indus valley civilization was basically an urban civilization and the
    people lived in well-planned and well-built towns, which were also the
    centers for trade. The ruins of Mohenjodaro and Harappa show that these were
    magnificent merchant cities-well planned, scientifically laid, and well
    looked after. They had wide roads and a well-developed drainage system. The
    houses were made of baked bricks and had two or more storeys.
    <br /><br />
    The highly civilized Harappans knew the art of growing cereals, and wheat
    and barley constituted their staple food. They consumed vegetables and
    fruits and ate mutton, pork and eggs as well. Evidences also show that they
    wore cotton as well as woollen garments. By 1500 BC, the Harappan culture
    came to an end. Among various causes ascribed to the decay of Indus Valley
    Civilization are the recurrent floods and other natural causes like
    earthquake, etc.
    <br /><br /><br />

    The Buddhist Era and Jainism Era <br />
    Two Great Darshans of Life developed in Ancient India - Buddism and Jainism,
    gave direction of religion and non-violence to world. <br />
    <br />
    Alexander's Invasion <br />
    In 326 BC, Alexander invaded India, after crossing the river Indus he
    advanced towards Taxila. He then challenged king Porus , ruler of the
    kingdom between the rivers Jhelum and Chenab. The Indians were defeated in
    the fierce battle, even though they fought with elephants, which the
    Macedonians had never before seen. Alexander captured Porus and, like the
    other local rulers he had defeated, allowed him to continue to govern his
    territory. <br />
    <br />
    Gupta Dynasty <br />
    After the Kushanas, the Guptas were the most important dynasty. The Gupta
    period has been described as the Golden Age of Indian history. The first
    famous king of the Gupta dynasty was Ghatotkacha's son Chandragupta I. He
    married Kumaradevi, the daughter of the chief of the Licchavis. This
    marriage was a turning point in the life of Chandragupta I. He got
    Pataliputra in dowry from the Lichhavis. From Pataliputra, he laid the
    foundation of his empire and started conquering many neighbouring states
    with the help of the Licchavis. He ruled over Magadha (Bihar), Prayaga and
    Saketa (east Uttar Pradesh). His kingdom extended from the river Ganges to
    Allahabad. Chandragupta I also got the title of Maharajadhiraja (King of
    Kings) and ruled for about fifteen years. <br />
    <br /><br />

    Harshavardhana Dynasty <br />
    With the commencement of the 7th century, Harshavardhana (606-647 A.D.)
    ascended the throne of Thaneshwar and Kannauj on the death of his brother,
    Rajyavardhana. By 612 Harshavardhana consolidated his kingdom in northern
    India. <br />
    <br />
    In 620 A.D. Harshavardhana invaded the Chalukya kingdom in the Deccan, which
    was then ruled by Pulakesin II. But the Chalukya resistance proved tough for
    Harshavardhana and he was defeated. Harshavardhana is well known for his
    religious toleration, able administration and diplomatic relations. He
    maintained diplomatic relations with China and sent envoys, who exchanged
    ideas of the Chinese rulers and developed their knowledge about each other.
